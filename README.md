# calc-react 🔢

Welcome to calc-react! This project is a fully interactive web-based calculator, built using React - a JavaScript library renowned for its focus on interactive, object-oriented web development. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview 📝

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a traditional desktop tool like a calculator can be recreated as a modern, web-based application using the power of React. The application offers all the standard features of a traditional calculator, wrapped in a sleek, user-friendly interface.

## How to Use 💻

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view and interact with the calculator.

## Available Commands 🖥️

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. The page will reload if you make any edits.

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder, bundling React in production mode and optimizing the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back! If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
